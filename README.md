## Machine Learning Workshop

In this repository, I am going to provide resources and materials in the machine learning workshop series that I am going to organize.
The topic and format of each session is not fixed and the format can be different in each session. You can find some of the topics and formats
that I have in mind in the following list, but this list is not exhaustive and other formats can be added to this list. 

- Reading a paper carefully and discussing about it.

- Reading and talking about a concept. E.g., we can organize a session to talk about program induction. In this kind of sessions, we will
review some of the important papers and contributions in that research area.

- Implemneting a paper and even deploy a toy model. 

- Learning about a framework or well-known package and trying to gain some hands-on experience.

- Working with released frameworks for reinforcement learning. E.g., Trying to learn more about "OpenSpiel: A framework for reinforcement learning in games"
or other similar frameworks.

- Becoming familiar with game engines to design an environment for RL agent. 

- Inspecting and examining a problem, interface, programmin language from design perspective. Trying to write and propose suitable design
solution for different kind of problems.

As I mentioned, the list can be expanded and the format is not limited to the aforementioned items.

## Resources and materials

After each session, I am going to write a pdf file that. This file summarize the main topic of the session, some side topics that we pointed out in the 
meeting and we did'nt talk about them thoroughly, and some code bases, frameworks and useful materials for further reading. 

You can find the pdf file in the Topics folder.
